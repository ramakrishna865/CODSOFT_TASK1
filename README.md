# CODSOFT_TASK1



Importing Libraries:

In the first part of the code, we import essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries provide tools for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
Loading the Titanic Dataset:

We load the Titanic dataset using Pandas. This dataset contains information about passengers, including their attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived or not.
Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning. In this section, we prepare the data for training the model.
Handling Missing Values:
We fill missing values in the 'Age' column with the median age of passengers. This ensures that all passengers have an age value.
We fill missing values in the 'Embarked' column with the most common embarkation point. This helps complete the data for this feature.
Encoding Categorical Features:
Machine learning models require numerical input, so we encode categorical features into numerical values.
The 'Sex' column is encoded as 0 for female and 1 for male using label encoding.
The 'Embarked' column is similarly encoded.
Selecting Relevant Features:
We choose specific features ('Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'Embarked') that are likely to be important for predicting survival.
Splitting the Data:

To evaluate our model's performance, we split the data into two sets: training and testing.
The train_test_split() function from scikit-learn is used to randomly split the data into training and testing sets.
X_train and y_train contain the features and labels for training, while X_test and y_test hold the features and labels for testing.
Building and Training the RandomForestClassifier:

We create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier, a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.
The model is trained using the training data (X_train and y_train) by calling the fit() method. During training, the model learns to make predictions based on the input features.
Making Predictions:

Once the model is trained, we use it to make predictions on the test data (X_test). The predict() method generates predictions for whether passengers in the test set survived or not.
Evaluating the Model:

To assess the model's performance, we calculate the accuracy by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) to the actual labels (y_test).
We also generate a classification report that provides detailed metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score. This report helps us understand how well the model performs for different classes (survived or not survived).
Additionally, we create a confusion matrix and display it as a heatmap using Seaborn. The confusion matrix visually represents true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Creating Visualizations:

Visualizations help us gain insights into the dataset and model results.
We provide examples of visualizations, such as a pie chart showing gender distribution, a bar plot illustrating survival rates by class, and a histogram displaying the age distribution of passengers.
Handling Missing Values:

We explain the importance of handling missing values in the dataset.
We introduce the concept of imputing missing values using scikit-learn's SimpleImputer and demonstrate how to use it to fill missing values with median values.
